This is my first blog post and in this blog I want to talk about what I will be blogging about and why? <br>
There are a number of reasons why I am blogging. i.e:
<br>
<ol>
<li>To become a better developer and post my journey along the way.</li>
<li>Get a better understanding of some topics that I am not too sure about and try to explain it in a blog post helping me to understand it along the way.</li>
<li>To improve my ui and ux skills. I want to take local businesses websites and create mock-ups to help me develop my design skills.</li>
<li>Finally to become more active in the developer community and to give something back.</li>
</ol>
